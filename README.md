# VFIO-qemu_config
qemu config, GPU&SSD passthrough on a Windows 10 VM without the nvidia 43 error, on the laptop Lenovo Legion5.

OS: Arch Linux
CPU: Ryzen 7 4800H
GPU: Nvidia 1650Ti
RAM: 16Go

I used two internel SSDs, one for the linux, the other passed through to the windows, and so far this config worked well.
But, I went back to back to full windows, due to the bad battery life of this laptop on linux.
